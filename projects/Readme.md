## The course involves four project topics:
- Topic 1: Space-time downscaling/super-reslution of sea surface dynamics
- Topic 2: Space-time interpolation of SSH fields from satellite altimetry data
- Topic 3: Short-term weather forecasting (weatherbench repo: [link](https://github.com/pangeo-data/WeatherBench)) 
- Topic 4: Classification of metocean processes in SAR-derived observations  

For each topic, we provide an introductory notebook to load and visualize the considered datasets.
